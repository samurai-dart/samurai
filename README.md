JS Interpreter in Dart.


## Possibilities
* Existing JS libraries that cannot be easily ported can be wrapped
(I'm looking at you, Hammer, and esprima!)
* Server-side rendering of compiled JS apps
  * Will require a headless DOM for Samurai

# Acknowledgements and Contributions
* A *huge* thanks to Asger Feldthaus and his [parsejs](https://github.com/asgerf/parsejs.dart) library.
